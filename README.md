# Deep Learning and Machine Learning Techniques for Cyber Attacks Detection on IoMT Devices

## Overview

This project focuses on the development of advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques for detecting cyber attacks on Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices in the healthcare sector. The increasing use of IoMT devices necessitates robust security measures to protect sensitive health information and ensure the safe operation of these devices.

## Dataset
We utilized the CIC IoMT Dataset which is a multi-protocol dataset for assessing IoMT device security. It can be accessed from the following link:
